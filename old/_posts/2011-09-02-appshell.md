Appshell

Appshell is an application framework that lets developers easily create application bundles of their applications. An application bundle is a single file that contains all the data and files needed to run an application, so all the user has to do is start it.

The application installed in the bundle doesn't have to be relocatable. Using unionfs to provide a virtual root environment, so application will relocatable.

Also, it is allow multiple version of an application in the system.

It is use compressed ISO to pack all files and use Unionfs to make a virtual environment for applications to run in.
