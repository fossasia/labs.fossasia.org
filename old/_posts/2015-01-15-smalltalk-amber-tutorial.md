Frontend Webapplication Development and Documentation

amber ( [http://amber-lang.net/](http://amber-lang.net/) ) is an implementation of smalltalk that compiles to javascript, similar to coffeescript and other languages.

in this project you should build a user management application similar to [https://github.com/aidarbek/angular](https://github.com/aidarbek/angular).

as you work you should document the process and write a tutorial on building an amber application.

in a second step, you should explore how to integrate other javascript frameworks, such as angular.js to drive the interface, writing angular controllers and services in amber smalltalk.

both versions should integrate with a RESTful backend, which is being created in a separate project.
