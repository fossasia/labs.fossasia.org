Create search functions and import pattern functions for Valentina


Valentina is a development project to edit pattern files for garments and textiles. The goal of the student project is to implement a method to choose additional design items, e.g. different collar styles, and to add them into a pattern during development.  In addition, the user should have the capability to organize their created patterns into categories, and conduct searches of patterns based on this organization. 

The student would develop user functions to add search tags to patterns, search for patterns, and select patterns from search results to load into the currently open pattern.

Background: One of the main ideas of Valentina is to enable users to create custom sized patterns based on applying an individual's measurement data to pattern formulas, independent of industry sizing standards. Similar industry software packages include Assyst (www.assyst-intl.com), Lektra (www.lectra.com), Grafis (http://www.grafis.com), plus others. Grafis in particular enables users to generate patterns based on formulas derived from pattern descriptions from standard books (e.g. books published by Mueller und Sohn.) Currently available industry software, however, does not aim at the DIY/maker or SME markets.
