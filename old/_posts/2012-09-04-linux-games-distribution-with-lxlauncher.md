Linux Game Development

The goal was to work on a Linux games distribution that can be burned on a CD or installed on a USB stick. Gaming is very popular in Asia. Existing popular games can be included. The project also needs to take care to include hardware drivers for a number of possible computer systems. The Linux distro will be based on Debian or Ubuntu. The interface will use lxlauncher.
