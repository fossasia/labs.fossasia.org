Smalltalk Developer Tools Development

Create a file editor and asset manager solution with smalltalk


Pharo Smalltalk is an integrated development environment for desktop and
web applications.  When developing a website, various assets, such as images,
javascript files and libraries, css files, static html content and html
templates need to be managed.

In this project you should develop a tool to manage these assets, and allow the
developer of the website to update and edit them.

It is expected that you spend the first week learning smalltalk before
working on the application.
