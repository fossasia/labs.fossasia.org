Replace the rmail library in the sup email client with mail


Sup is an advanced mail client for the terminal, written in ruby.

it uses the rmail ruby gem which is no longer maintained.
a project to port sup to use the newer mail gem has been started but not completed.
the port is functional but some pieces are missing. in particular encryption
support still needs to be ported.

in this project you are expected to complete the port to the new mail gem, to
the point that sup developers can base their official releases on your work.
