Developer Tools Development

Improve the tooling for the sTeam collaboration platform

Open sTeam is a collaboration platform developed at the University of Paderborn in germany.
It is no longer developed at the university, but still in use.

One of the shortcoming of sTeam are development tools.
sTeam supports a remote commandline and editing interface, and prototypes for
exporting the sTeam database to git.

In this project you will create new and improve existing tools such as:
database import and export to and from git
TLS support for the remote commandline client
a vim plugin for remote editing of database contents
packaging to simplify the deployment of sTeam
and more...

sTeam is written in Pike, a programming language similar to Java and python.
Pike is not hard to learn so you will have no trouble writing pike code within
a few days.
