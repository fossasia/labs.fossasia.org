Rebuild the webinterface for the sTeam collaboration platform using a REST api


Open sTeam is a collaboration platform developed at the University of Paderborn in germany.
It is no longer developed at the university, but still in use.

http://societyserver.org is built with a branch of sTeam, and its developer
recently created a RESTful API interface for it.

In this project you will rewrite the webinterface to use the new RESTful api.
Using the angular.js framework you will develop interfaces to navigate and
change sTeams document structure, discussion forums, messaging, chat and a new
admin interface.
You will also need to extend the RESTful API to support functionality not
available yet.

Skill level: medium
Useful skills: javascript, angular.js, user interface design, RESTful APIs.
Mentors: Martin Bähr
