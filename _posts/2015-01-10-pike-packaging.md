Package Pike 8.0 for all Linux distributions

The Pike Programming Language is nearing its 8.0 release.
Currently only Debian and Gentoo have pike packages.

In this project you should provide packages for all major Linux distributions.
starting with Fedora and openSUSE, but also Arch and others.
an RPM spec file already exists, but it may need to be updated.
It is probably best to use the openSUSE build service, however care needs to be
taken that the resulting packages satisfy the various distributions
requirements for acceptance.
