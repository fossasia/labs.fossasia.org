Website Design and Development


Rebuild the website for the Beijing GNU/Linux User Group with sTeam


Open sTeam is a collaboration platform developed at the University of Paderborn in germany.
It is no longer developed at the university, but still in use.

[http://societyserver.org](http://societyserver.org) is built with a branch of sTeam, and its developer
recently created a RESTful API interface for it.

The Beijing GNU/Linux User Group uses an old Joomla based website, which should be replaced.

In this project you will develop a new website for the BLUG using the sTeam platform.
You should provide a similar set of features, such as articles, events, wiki,
forum, chat, polls, gallery and planet...

The website should be developed using the angular.js framework, using the new RESTful API.
you may need to extend the API for specific features.

content from the old site should be imported to the new site were possible
(articles, events, wiki and forum)

The design may be copied or changed at your digression.
