LuCI or LuCI2 is the default web interface in OpenWRT and supports themes.

Create a new LuCI theme using twitter's bootstrap3. You could use the existing bootstrap theme as coding base or build a new theme from scratch. There're lot of features, LuCI could benefit from, including a much more easier way to create themes. The project focus can either be more technical or design. Things to do:

* upgrade to bootstrap3 (less;css;buildsystem)
* create more bootstrap and meta components (e.g. data tables, node info boxes)
* enhance kitchensink to style guide
* the new theme also works on mobile devices
* polish freifunk themes, or create a new one
* convert icons to vector graphics
* minimize everything so it will fit on 4MB flash devices
