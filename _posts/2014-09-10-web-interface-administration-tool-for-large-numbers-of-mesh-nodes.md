OpenWRT-extension

Kalua is a hardware-independent OpenWRT-extension (using busybox-ash as main-language) for setting up, monitore and manage many, large wifi-mesh-networks for different locations. Large networks consist of hundreds and even thousand of nodes. Administration of routers, e.g. ESSID setting is a long process.
