Smalltalk Application Development


Create a smalltalk application for offline text search


This application is to enable the user to research a set of books or texts,
like an encyclopedia, or some other topical book collection.

The users of this application want to be able to search phrases and read the
documents listed in the search-results using a simple, distraction free
interface

    The application should only search in files in a specified directory on the mobile device
    The interface should offer a box to enter the search text, or browse the
      list of included documents.
    Search results should display the name of the name of the document and the
      line/or paragraph where the search text was found in the file
    Each document has one or more categories
    Browse and search should be able to filter on these categories
    The Application is to be distributed with content, so
    A tool should enable to repackage the app with new content,
    or alternatively, an online update system for new content should be provided.
    The application should handle multiple languages, and support
      crossreferencing the same document in another language.

This application should be developed on the pharo smalltalk platform. Documents
should be stored within the application.

It is expected that you spends the first week learning smalltalk before working
on the application.
